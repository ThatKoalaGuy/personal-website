					<p>
						Hi! Iâ€™m Domen, a passionate developer from Slovenia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡®. I love
						building things and learning new technologies.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I started coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have since
						expanded my skills to include Java, C, and frameworks like Tailwind
						CSS. I enjoy solving problems and constantly improving my knowledge.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I am interested in operating systems and am looking forward to
						contributing to the Linux kernel.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						When Iâ€™m not coding, I like reading about tech trends, playing video
						games, and practicing languages (I speak Slovenian natively, with
						good English and beginner German).
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Iâ€™m currently focused on growing as a full-stack developer,
						contributing to open source projects, and building tools that make
						life easier for others.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just say hi!
